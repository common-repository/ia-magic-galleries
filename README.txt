== Installation ==

INSTALLATION: Installation is simple and straightforward. In your WordPress dashboard, go to Plugins > Add New, search for IA Magic Galleries, and click to install the plugin. Then, activate the plugin. The plugin will automatically and seamlessly register itself with our SAS server and obtain all the necessary resources to run your galleries. This will take a few seconds, so do not press the activation button multiple times.

HOW TO USE: Adding a gallery to a page is also extremely simple. Just add the IA Magic Galleries block to your page. The block will transform into the interactive gallery setup environment on your editing page. The intuitive interface and preview options will guide you. Your media will be visible inside the interface.

Alternatively, using the same interactive interface, a gallery can be created as a standalone post inside the WordPress admin panel. It then may be displayed directly as a post or added to a page as a shortcode.
